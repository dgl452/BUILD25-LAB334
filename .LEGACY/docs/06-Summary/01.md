## 1. Lab-334 Teardown

!!! quote "IN-VENUE PARTICIPANTS: Please "End Session" on Skillable VM To Release Resources"

This lab uses GitHub Codespaces as the development environment. 

- Personal accounts have a free quota - let's conserve it.
- Commit all your changes to your personal fork first
- Click "Delete Codespaces" - release CPU and Storage quotas.

This lab uses Azure AI Search and Azure Open AI models.

- (In-Venue) - just "Kill Session" on the Skillable VM to release resources
- (At-Home) - delete the resource group (and purge soft-deleted resources)

## 2. Lab-334 Recap

Let's recap what we did today. In this workshop, you learned:

1. To use the Azure AI Portal for manual evaluation
1. To use the Azure AI Evaluations SDK for code-first evaluation
1. To use the Simulator to generate evaluation datasets
1. To use the Built-in evaluators for quality & safety assessment
1. To create a Custom evaluator for your application needs

Along the way, you got a better intuition for how evaluations play a critical role in every stage of the Generative AI Ops journey
