# 2. Quickstart


!!! quote "BY THE END OF THIS SECTION YOU SHOULD HAVE"

    - Visited the Azure portal and verified resource deployments
    - Visited the Azure AI Foundry portal and verified model deployments
    - Configured your local development environment for code-first usage

!!! info "SETUP WILL TAKE ABOUT 5 MINUTES TO COMPLETE - BUT WILL SPEED UP THINGS LATER!"

## 1. Pick Your Path

Before we dive into the labs, let's make sure we have our infrasructure setup correctly, and provision our local development environment to work with it. This lab is setup for use by both attendees in venue (Microsoft Build) and learners at home (self-paced). Pick your tab here. This context is automatically enforced throughout the guide, once set.


=== "MSBuild Attendee"

    !!! info "You will be using a pre-provisioned Azure subscription from Skillable!"

        - [X] You should have already launched the Skillable VM
        - [X]  Check that you have an Azure credentials section in the VM panel (right)
        - [X] Verify that it shows a valid username and password. We'll use this later.


=== "At-Home Learner"

    !!! quote "You will need an Azure subscription of your own to continue!"

        - We will use the [Contoso Chat](https://aka.ms/aitour/contoso-chat) sample for convenience
        - Make sure you have a valid Azure subscription with access (and quota) for required models

## 2. Provision Infrastructure

!!! tip "Some evaluation features are available only in select regions. We recommend using **East US 2**"

=== "MSBuild Attendee"

    !!! info "You will be using a pre-provisioned Azure subscription from Skillable!"

        - [X] Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) - sign in with Skillable Azure credentials
        - [X] Verify that you have a single resource group (rg-AITOUR) - it should have 35 deployments
        - [X] Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://ai.azure.com) - sign in (select the above credential)
        - [X] Verify you have a single Azure AI project listed - click to see the detailed view
        - [X] Click the "Models + Endpoints" option - verify you have 3 models deployed

    **Congratulations! You are ready to configure your local environment**

=== "At-Home Learner"

    !!! quote "You will need to provision the infrastructure yourself"

        - [X] Complete [these steps](https://microsoft.github.io/aitour-build-a-copilot-on-azure-ai/2-Workshop/01-Setup/2-Provisioning/01-Self-Guided/) to provision Contoso Chat - use **AITOUR** as the env name
        - [X] Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) - sign in with the same Azure credentials
        - [X] Verify that you have a single resource group (rg-AITOUR) - it should have 35 deployments
        - [X] Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://ai.azure.com) - sign in (select the above credential)
        - [X] Verify you have a single Azure AI project listed - click to see the detailed view
        - [X] Click the "Models + Endpoints" option - verify you have 3 models deployed

## 3. Configure Environment Vars

!!! info "From here on, both in-venue and at-home learners get the same experience"

- Copy the `.env.sample` to a new `.env` file

    ```bash title="" linenums="0"
    cp env.sample .env
    ```

- Here's what that looks like - let's start filling in the values, next

    ```bash title="" linenums="0"
    # Azure Open AI
    AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=            # Format: "https://aoai-XXXX.openai.azure.com/"
    AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=             # Format: string of numbers
    AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT="gpt-4o-mini"         
    AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION="2025-01-01-preview"

    # Azure AI Foundry project
    AZURE_AI_CONNECTION_STRING=        # "REGION;SUBSCRIPTION-ID;RESOURCEGROUP;AIPROJECT"
    AZURE_AI_INFERENCE_ENDPOINT=       # "https://aoai-XXXXXX.services.ai.azure.com/models"

    # Comparison
    AZURE_OPENAI_GPT4_EP=              # "https://aoai-XXXXX.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/gpt-4/chat/completions?api-version=2025-01-01-preview"
    AZURE_OPENAI_GPT4OMINI_EP=         # "https://aoai-XXXXX.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/gpt-4o-mini/chat/completions?api-version=2025-01-01-preview"

    # Populate data
    COSMOS_ENDPOINT=                   # "https://cosmos-contoso-xxxx.documents.azure.com:443/"
    AZURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT=             # "https://srch-xxx.search.windows.net"
    ```

### 3.1 Project Overview

!!! quote "WHY DO THIS: This configures local dev environment to talk to our Azure AI project"

- Return to the Azure AI Foundry portal tab in your browser. Click on the AI Project overview page. You should see a page like this, with the highlighted sections. 

    ![AI Project](./../../img/1-Workshop/02-aiproject-overview.png)

- Use this to populate the following environment variables:

    - [X] Set `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` value to the _API key_ 
    - [X] Set `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` value to the _Azure OpenAI endpoint_ 
    - [X] Set `AZURE_AI_CONNECTION_STRING` value to the _Project Connection String_

### 3.2 Models + Endpoints

!!! quote "WHY DO THIS: This configures local dev environment to talk to specific model deployments"

- Next, click on **Models + endpoints** - you should see a list of deployed models. Verify that you see these three models listed.

    ![AI Project](./../../img/1-Workshop/02-model-deployments.png)

- Next, click on the `gpt-4` model. You should see details page as shown
    - [X] Set `AZURE_OPENAI_GPT4_EP=` value to the highlighted Target URI

    ![AI Project](./../../img/1-Workshop/02-model-details.png)

- Next, repeat this for the `gpt-4o-mini` model and copy its Target URI
    - [X] Set `AZURE_OPENAI_GPT4OMINI_EP=` value to this value


### 3.3 Azure Portal Resources

!!! quote "WHY DO THIS: This configures local dev environment to help populate data later"

- Visit the [Azure Portal page](https://portal.azure.com) - and click on the `rg-AITOUR` page

- You should see something like this: Check that deployments show **35 succeeded**
    ![AI Project](./../../img/1-Workshop/02-portal-deployments.png)

- Click on the Search service in that list. You should see this:
    - [X] Set `AZURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT=` to the URI on this page
        ![AI Project](./../../img/1-Workshop/02-search-url.png)

- Click on the CosmosDB resource in that list. You should see this:
    - [X] Set `COSMOS_ENDPOINT=` to the URI on this page

## 4. Update User Roles

!!! quote "WHY DO THIS: Make sure your user identity has access permissions to populate data"

- We're almost done! All your environment variables are ready. Our local development environment is now "talking" to the Contoso Chat deployment
- Now, we need to populate data (setup search index and customer database) - we need permissions for this. Run this script in the VS Code terminal. _It should complete in 1-2 minutes_. *Congratulations - you now have the right roles to update resources*

    ```bash title="" linenums="0"
    ./scripts/update-roles.sh
    ```

## 5. Run Notebooks

!!! quote "WHY DO THIS: Populate the Contoso product and customer data"
