    "# Lab 03: Explore Built-in Safety Evaluators\n",

    "By the end of this lab, you will know:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The built-in safety evaluators available in Azure AI Foundry\n",
    "1. How to run a safety evaluator with a test prompt (to understand usage)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Generation Safety Evaluation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. This provides a comprehensive approach to evaluating generated responses for risk and safety severity scores.\n",
    "1. Evaluators are generated through the Azure AI Foundry Evaluation service, which employs a set of LLMs.\n",
    "1. Each evaluator model is provided specific risk definitions and annotates evaluation results accordingly.\n",
    "1. An aggregate \"defect rate\" is calculated by the percentage of undesired content detected in the response from your AI system.\n",
    "1. You can run the evaluator with your own test dataset or prompt, or use the AI Red Teaming Agent for automated red teaming scans.\n",
    "1. You can run the Content Safety Evaluator to get a composite assessment with 4 evaluators on your dataset at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Risk and Safety Risks evaluated are**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hateful and unfair content\n",
    "- Sexual content, Violent content\n",
    "- Self-harm related content\n",
    "- Protected material content\n",
    "- Indirect attack jailbreak\n",
    "- Code vulnerability\n",
    "- Ungrounded attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll explore each of these with a test prompt to help you build intuition on how to use them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then we'll run the Content Safety Evaluator to get a composite assessment with 4 evaluators on your dataset at once.\n"
