# Evaluate and improve the quality and safety of your AI applications"

## Workshop Description

You’ve built a custom AI application grounded in your enterprise data. **How do you ensure response quality and safety?** Join us as we explore AI-assisted evaluation workflows with built-in and custom evaluators on Azure AI. Learn what each metric represents, then understand how to analyze the scores for your specific application. Learn why observability is key, and how the generated telemetry can be used both locally, and in the cloud, to help you assess and debug your application performance.  

- **Level:** Intermediate/Advanced
- **Duration:** 75 minutes

## Content Tracks

The in-venue sessions are **75 minutes** - 15-min instructor talk with 60-mins hands-on labs. The lab is also setup for self-paced learning (no time limit) using your own subscription at home.

To support both kinds of learning (time-constrained in venue, self-paced at home) we have organized content into two "tracks"

1. **Workshop** - this track is for the in-venue attendees. Our goal is to get you through the content within 60 minutes while meeting the learning objectives.
1. **Homework** - this tracks is for _continuing the learning journey_ at home. This allows you to build on what you learned in venue and explore at your own pace.

!!! info "In-Venue Attendees: You will have a personal copy of this repo by the end of the workshop"

    You can now revisit the repo at home, with your own subscription, to explore all the content at your own pace - with your personal subscription. The workshop track till also identify **Homework** segments that we encourage you to try out at home, to further build intuition for that specific topic.
