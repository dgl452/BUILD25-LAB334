# Evaluate and improve the quality and safety of your AI applications"

## Workshop Description

You want to build a custom AI application grounded in your enterprise data. **How do you ensure response quality and safety** so you can build the trust and confidence of your users?

In this hands-on workshop, we'll explore the role of evaluations in the GenAIOps lifecycle and learn to use the Azure AI Foundry evaluations SDK to simulate test datasets, run built-in quality and safety evaluators, create custom evaluators, and visualize & analyze evaluation results. 

**Level:** Intermediate/Advanced. <br/>
**Duration:** 75 minutes
