# 1. Dev Environment


!!! quote "By the end of this section you should have"

    - An Azure subscription provisioned with required resources
    - A GitHub Codespaces environment configured with env variables
    - Validated both with a set of simple checks

    - **DURATION:** 
        - 10 mins (In-Venue) - with pre-provisioned resources
        - 20 mins (Self-Guided) - to also provision resources

---

## Before You Begin

_We designed this lab to be used at Microsoft Build (with a pre-provisioned Azure subscription) or at home (with your own Azure subscription). Just pick your path to get the right instructions._


!!! info "ARE YOU A MICROSOFT BUILD ATTENDEE OR A SELF-GUIDED LEARNER?"

    === "I AM A SESSION ATTENDEE"

        - [X] Yes, I am currently at Microsoft Build. 
        - [X] I'll use a Skillable-provided Azure subscription**

    === "I AM A SELF-GUIDED LEARNER"

        - Yes, I am working on this at home. 
        - I'll be using my own Azure subscription**

---

## 1. Login with Azure CLI

_You are currently running in a GitHub Codespaces environment. Let's authenticate to Azure so we can access resources from code._

1. Open the VS Code terminal and run this command - then follow instructions.

    ```bash title="" linenums="0"
    az login --use-device-code
    ```

1. You will be prompted to enter Azure credentials (username and password). Use the right credentials as described below:

    === "I AM A SESSION ATTENDEE"

        - [X] Switch to the browser tab with the Skillable VM.
        - [X] Use the Azure credentials provided in the instructions panel there.

    === "I AM A SELF-GUIDED LEARNER"

        - [X] Use your own Azure credentials to complete this login step.

    Return to the VS Code terminal - **you should be logged in successfully.**

## 2. Review Azure AI Project

_Your Azure AI project is the main resource for developing and managing your generative AI application. Let's review it now._


=== "I AM A SESSION ATTENDEE"

    - Visit [https://ai.azure.com](https://ai.azure.com) - login with the same Azure account.
    - You'll see a pre-provisioned Azure AI project listed - click it to get the page below. 
    - ☑️ We'll use the highlighted sections here later to set env variables.

        ![Foundry](./../../img/self-guided/01-Create-Project-06.png)

=== "I AM A SELF-GUIDED LEARNER"

    - Visit [https://ai.azure.com](https://ai.azure.com) - login with the same Azure account.
    - You will see a **Create project** button - with no pre-existing projects.
    - Create a new Azure AI project [using a tutorial like this](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/tutorials/copilot-sdk-create-resources?tabs=macos).
    - Deploy 3 models (`gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt4`, and `text-embedding-ada-002`) 
    - Add an Azure AI Search service resource (during setup, for convenience)
    - The created project overview looks like this. **Leave this tab open** - we'll use it later

## 3. Review: Model Deployments

We need three models: a _chat_ model (`gpt-4o-mini`), a _judge model_ (`gpt4`), and an _embedding_ model (`text-embedding-ada-002`). Let's locate this section in our Azure AI project, next.

1. In the above page, click **Models + Deployments** in sidebar - you see the page below.
1. Verify you see the same 3 models - with the names as shown below.
1. ✅ We have already set these for you in the `.env` file you will customize later.

## 4. Configure Azure AI Search

_The "Manual Evaluation" exercise will use the Azure AI Search index from the evaluations portal. To support this, we need to make one small change to default configuration. Let's do that, next_.
  
1. Open a new browser tab - visit [https://portal.azure.com/#browse/resourcegroups](https://portal.azure.com/#browse/resourcegroups)
1. Login with the same Azure account - click the `rg-AITOUR` entry to get the page below
            
    ![Portal](./../../img/self-guided/01-Azure-Portal-03.png)

1. Click the **Search service** resource - click **Keys** in sidebar to get the page below
1. In the **API Access Control** section - click **Both**, then confirm "Yes" in pop-up
            
    ![Portal](./../../img/self-guided/01-Azure-Portal-06.png)

1. ✅ Your search service is now setup for access from both SDK and portal.

## 5. Update Env Variables

_Now, let's make sure our GitHub Codespaces environment can talk to these resources by setting the relevant environment variables. Return to the GitHub Codespaces tab now._.

1. Run this command to create the `.env` file

    ```bash title="" linenums="0"
    cp .env.sample .env
    ```

1. Open the `.env` file created in the editor. It should look like this: 

    ```text title="" linenums="0"
    # Azure Open AI
    AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=
    AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=
    AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT="gpt-4o-mini"
    AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION="2025-01-01-preview"

    # Azure AI Foundry project
    AZURE_AI_CONNECTION_STRING=

    # Populate data
    AZURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT=

    #Labs
    LAB_CHAT_MODEL="gpt-4o-mini"
    LAB_JUDGE_MODEL="gpt4"

    #GitHub
    GITHUB_TOKEN=
    ```

1. Switch to the browser tab containing your Azure AI Foundry project page. Click on `Overview` in the sidebar to get the view below. Then use the highlighted sections to populate _.env_.

    - [X] Set `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` - to value in Azure OpenAI endpoint red box
    - [X] Set `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` - to value in API key red box
    - [X] Set `AZURE_AI_CONNECTION_STRING` - to value in Project connection string red box

    ![Foundry](./../../img/self-guided/01-Create-Project-06.png)

1. Switch to the browser tab containing your Azure Portal view. Click the _search service_ resource to view its details page. Look for the `Essentials` panel in the Overview section.
    - [X] Set `AZURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT_ - to the "Uri" value in this panel.

**Your environment variables are set!**
