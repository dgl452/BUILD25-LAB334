# 1. Dev Environment


!!! quote "By the end of this section you should have"

    - An Azure subscription provisioned with required resources
    - A GitHub Codespaces environment configured with env variables
    - Validated both with a set of simple checks

    - **DURATION:** 
        - 10 mins (In-Venue) - with pre-provisioned resources
        - 20 mins (Self-Guided) - to also provision resources

---

## Before You Begin

_We designed this lab to be used at Microsoft Build (with a pre-provisioned Azure subscription) or at home (with your own Azure subscription). Just pick your path to get the right instructions._


!!! info "ARE YOU A MICROSOFT BUILD ATTENDEE OR A SELF-GUIDED LEARNER?"

    === "I AM A SESSION ATTENDEE"

        - [X] Yes, I am currently at Microsoft Build. 
        - [X] I'll use a Skillable-provided Azure subscription**

    === "I AM A SELF-GUIDED LEARNER"

        - Yes, I am working on this at home. 
        - I'll be using my own Azure subscription**

---

## 1. Login with Azure CLI

_You are currently running in a GitHub Codespaces environment. Let's authenticate to Azure so we can access resources from code._

1. Open the VS Code terminal and run this command - then follow instructions.

    ```bash title="" linenums="0"
    az login --use-device-code
    ```

1. You will be prompted to enter Azure credentials (username and password). Use the right credentials as described below:

    === "I AM A SESSION ATTENDEE"

        - [X] Switch to the browser tab with the Skillable VM.
        - [X] Use the Azure credentials provided in the instructions panel there.

    === "I AM A SELF-GUIDED LEARNER"

        - [X] Use your own Azure credentials to complete this login step.

    Return to the VS Code terminal - **you should be logged in successfully.**

## 2. Review Azure AI Project

_Your Azure AI project is the main resource for developing and managing your generative AI application. Let's review it now._


=== "I AM A SESSION ATTENDEE"

    - Visit [https://ai.azure.com](https://ai.azure.com) - login with the same Azure account.
    - You should have a pre-provisioned Azure AI project listed on this page. 
    - Click on it - you should see a details page like this. 
    - **Leave this tab open** - we'll use it later to configure environment variables

        ![Foundry](./../../img/self-guided/01-Create-Project-06.png)

=== "I AM A SELF-GUIDED LEARNER"

    - Visit [https://ai.azure.com](https://ai.azure.com) - login with the same Azure account.
    - You will see a **Create project** button - with no pre-existing projects.
    - Create a new Azure AI project [using a tutorial like this](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/tutorials/copilot-sdk-create-resources?tabs=macos).
    - Deploy 3 models (`gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt4`, and `text-embedding-ada-002`) 
    - Add an Azure AI Search service resource (during setup, for convenience)
    - The created project overview looks like this. **Leave this tab open** - we'll use it later

        ![Foundry](./../../img/self-guided/01-Create-Project-06.png) 

---

## 3. Review: Model Deployments

_We need 3 models - a chat model (`gpt-4o-mini`), an evaluation model (`gpt4`), and an embedding model (`text-embedding-ada-002`). Let's check if they are deployed in our project._

1. In the Azure AI project overview page, click on **Models + Deployments** in the sidebar. 
1. You should see a list of models - with 3 models deployed as shown below.
1. We will use the _Name_ values later when setting up environment variables.

    ![Foundry](./../../img/self-guided/01-Deploy-Models-09.png)

---

## 4. Configure Azure AI Search

_We will use Azure AI Search from both portal and code - to do this, we need to update its default access to support "Both" keys and managed identity_.

    
1. Visit the [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com) - login with the same Azure account.
1. Click the default resource group (`rg-AITOUR`) to see resource group details.
1. Click the **Search service** resource in the list, as shown below.
            
    ![Portal](./../../img/self-guided/01-Azure-Portal-03.png)

1. Select the **Keys** option in the sidebar of the Search resource page.
1. Click **Both** for "API Access Control" - and confirm the change ("Yes") in the pop-up dialog.
1. Click the **Overview** option in the sidebar - **leave this tab open** for next steps.

## 5. Configure Env Variables

_To work with Azure resources from code, we need to configure the environment variables in a `.env` file. Let's do that now._


1. Return to GitHub Codespaces - run this command in the VS Code terminal.

    ```bash title="" linenums="0"
    cp .env.sample .env
    ```

1. This creates a new `.env` file as shown below, with some pre-filled variables. 

    ```text title="" linenums="0"
    # Azure Open AI
    AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT= 
    AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=  
    AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT="gpt-4o-mini"
    AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION="2025-01-01-preview"

    # Azure AI Foundry project
    AZURE_AI_CONNECTION_STRING= 

    # Populate data
    COSMOS_ENDPOINT= 
    AZURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT=

    #GitHub
    GITHUB_TOKEN= 

    #Labs
    LAB_CHAT_MODEL="gpt-4o-mini"
    LAB_JUDGE_MODEL="gpt-4"
    ```

1. Let's populate the **Azure Open AI** variables. Open the tab with the Azure AI project overview page as shown below. Use the red highlighted sections to find relevant values:

    - [X] Set `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT_ - to value in Azure OpenAI endpoint red box
    - [X] Set `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY - to value in API key red box
    - [X] Set `AZURE_AI_CONNECTION_STRING_ - to value in Project connection string red box

    ![Foundry](./../../img/self-guided/01-Create-Project-06.png)

1. Let's update the Search endpoint. Return to the Azure portal tab with the Search resource open. Look for the `Essentials` panel in the **Overview** section. 
    - [X] Set `AZURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT_ - to the "Uri" value in this panel.

**Your environment variables are set!**

## 6. Populate Search Index

We can now populate the search index using our data. This is a 2-step process that takes a few minutes to complete.

1. Open the VS Code terminal in GitHub Codespaces and run this command. This will give our user identity access roles to update the search resource.

    ```bash title="" linenums="0"
    ./scripts/update-search-roles.sh
    ```

1. Open the `data/product_info/create-azure-search.ipynb` notebook in editor, and run it.
    - Select Kernel - use the default Python environment.
    - Clear Outputs, then "Run All" - this will populate the search index using local product data
1. Verify the product search index was created:
    - Visit the Azure AI Search resource page in Azure portal above
    - Click on **Search Explorer** - you should see a `contoso-products` search index.

**Your search index is ready!**
