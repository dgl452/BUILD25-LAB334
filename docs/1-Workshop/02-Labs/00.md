# Lab 0: Simulate Datasets

!!! quote "In this lab, you will learn to generate a synthedic dataset using the Simulator."

    By the end of this lab, you should be should know:

    - [X] What the Simulator is and how to use it
    - [X] How to generate a synthetic dataset from a search index
    - [X] How to run an evaluation on the synthetic dataset

## 1. Populate the Search Index

First, we need to create the search index and populate it with our data. For convenience, we have provided a dataset and a notebook that will do this for you. Just follow these two steps:

### 1.1. Update Access Roles

We need our user identity to have specific access roles to the search resource - this step should take just a few seconds.

1. Return to the GitHub Codespaces environment (browser tab)
1. Run this command in the VS Code terminal - it completes within a minute or so.

    ```bash title="" linenums="0"
    ./scripts/update-search-roles.sh
    ```

### 1.2 Upload The Data

We have a `data/product_info/products.csv` file with product data. In this step, we just run the notebook that uploads the data and creates a search index called `contoso-products`. This step should take just a minute or so to complete.

1. Open the `data/product_info/create-azure-search.ipynb` notebook in editor.
    - Select Kernel - use the default Python environment (see: `3.12.10`)
    - Click "Clear Outputs", then "Run All" - this takes 1-2 minutes to complete
    - âœ… | You should see: _"uploading 20 documents to index contoso-products"_

### 1.3 Validate Index Creation

1. **Verify the product search index was created**
    - Return to Azure Portal browser tab - it should be open to the Search service page:
        ![Foundry](./../../img/self-guided/01-Azure-Portal-04.png)
    - Click on **Search explorer** - you see `contoso-products` as shown. Click "Search" to see default search results for an empty query. It should look like this:
        ![Foundry](./../../img/self-guided/01-Index-Populate.png)

1. **Test the Index**
    - Copy this query into the search box and click **Search**:

        ```bash title="" linenums="0"
        Something to eat on
        ```
    
    - Look at the `value` field - you see something like this. You got a semantically meaningful result that goes beyond keyword matching. _This is an example of vector search_.

## 2. Use Simulator with Index

!!! info "All labs are setup as Jupyter notebooks - just follow these instructions:"

1. Open the `labs/00-simulate-datasets.ipynb` notebook in the VS Code editor.
1. Click **Select Kernel** in the top right corner of the notebook - pick default Python kernel.
1. Click **Clear All Outputs** in the top menu bar of the notebook - clears output from prior runs.
1. Click **Run All Cells** in the top menu bar of the notebook - let the run complete.

Now, review the notebook cell-by-cell to understand the steps. Answer questions or try alternative options when prompted, to build your understanding of the code.
