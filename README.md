# Evaluate and improve the quality and safety of your AI applications"

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This lab is designed for use in both **instructor-led** (75-mins, in-venue) and **self-guided** (self-paced, at home) sessions.
> 1. **Instructor-led** session attendees. Listen to the in-venue instructions and follow directions in the Skillable VM panel.
> 1. **Self-guided** session attendees. You will need to take a few extra steps for setup. Start with the [Self-Guided: Quickstart](#self-guided-quickstart) below.

## Workshop Description

You’ve been asked to build a custom AI application grounded in your enterprise data. **How do you ensure that acceptable response quality and safety** to build the trust and confidence of your users.

In this hands-on workshop, we'll explore the role of evaluations in the GenAIOps lifecycle and learn to use the Azure AI Foundry evaluations SDK to simulate test datasets, run built-in quality and safety evaluators, create custom evaluators, and visualize & analyze evaluation results. 

**Level:** Intermediate/Advanced. <br/>
**Duration:** 75 minutes

## Content Tracks

!!! info "IN-VENUE PARTICIPANTS: Prioritize completing the Workshop track before exploring Homework labs"

The content is structured in two parts:

1. A core **Workshop Track** that can be completed in under an hour (e.g., in-venue)
1. A bonus **Homework Track** that can be completed at home (i.e., at your own pace)

Doing the homework track will require you to **have your own subscription** to work on at home.  The instructions will show you how to fork the repo to get a personal copy, to continue working on at home.
